      <p>The Museum of Modern Art's publicly available datasets contain detailed metadata on over 100,000 works by more than 15,000 artists from around the world spanning 150 years. As MoMA’s curatorial team puts it: The Museum of Modern Art acquired its first artworks in 1929, the year it was established. Today, the Museum’s evolving collection contains almost 200,000 works from around the world spanning the last 150 years. The collection includes an ever-expanding range of visual expression, including painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing, photography, architecture, design, film, and media and performance art. </p>
      <p>MoMA is committed to helping everyone understand, enjoy, and use the collection. The Museum’s website features 81,747 artworks from 26,352 artists. This research dataset contains 138,124 records, representing all of the works that have been accessioned into MoMA’s collection and cataloged in the database.</p>

	  Selections from Picasso's Periods</h1>
      <center><img src="images/pablo-picasso-periods-3-element.jpeg" width="750" height="600" alt=""/></center>
      <p>With a career that spanned 79 years and included success in painting, sculpting, ceramics, poetry, illustration, stage design, and writing, Picasso's tendency to experiment with his craft is unsurprising. However, the extent to which his style changed in each discipline — particularly in painting — is arguably unlike that of any other modern artist. Therefore, in order to trace his stylistic evolution, Picasso's body of work is often divided into periods: early work, the Blue Period, the Rose Period, the African Period, Cubism, Neoclassicism, Surrealism, and later work.</p><br>

	  Early Work</h3>
      <p>Pablo Picasso was born in 1881 to two artistic parents, and from an early age his father taught him formal drawing techniques, culminating in a mastery of oil painting when he was just eight years old. At thirteen, Picasso began his career as an artist. At this time, he worked in a realist style, depicting subjects authentically, and employed a true-to-life color palette. He particularly enjoyed painting scenes inspired by his Catholic faith and portraits of his family members. This traditional, stylistically academic approach is evident in his church-inspired paintings and his portrayals of loved ones such as <em>The Altarboy</em> (1896) and <em>Portrait of the Artist's Mother</em> (1896).</p><br>

        <p>From 1897, however, Picasso's paintings took on a less realistic quality. Undoubtedly stirred by influential figures working at the time, such as Expressionist Edvard Munch and Post-Impressionist  Toulouse-Lautrec, these pieces — like <em>The Artist's Sister Lola</em> (ca. 1899-1900) — convey Picasso's growing interest in experimenting with a more unrestricted, avant-garde style.</p>
        <p>“The world today doesn't make sense,” Picasso famously said, “so why should I paint pictures that do?”</p><br>

		<h3>
          <!-- Tagline -->
		Blue Period (1901-1904)</h3>
		<p>In 1901, Picasso appeared to have entirely abandoned realism. This is particularly clear in his preference for color, which evolved from naturalistic hues to cooler tones. This change in color pallette lasted until 1904, and is now characterized as the artist's Blue Period. Art of this period is somber in both color and in subject matter — an approach thought to have been catalyzed by depression due to a close friend's suicide. The works often feature figures living in poverty or despair, like the gaunt guitar player in <em>The Old Guitarist</em> (ca. 1903-1904) and the despondent <em>Absinthe Drinker</em> (1901).</p><br>

          <!-- Tagline -->
		Rose Period (1904-1906)</h3>
		<p>After moving to Montmartre, a Bohemian district in Paris, Picasso shifted his focus from individuals living in despair to entertainers, including harlequins, acrobats, and other circus performers. As the artist transitioned to his Rose Period around this time, he continued to depict figures in his characteristically painterly style. However, while blue tones are still present in these paintings, they are contrasted with distinctly warmer and more vibrant hues, as can be seen in <em>Acrobat and Young Harlequin</em> (1905) and <em>Mother and Child, Acrobats</em> (ca. 1904-1905).</p><br>

		<h3>
          <!-- Tagline -->
		African Period (1906-1909)</h3> 
		<p>For the three years that followed his Rose Period, Picasso found inspiration in Oceanic and African art. Known as his African Period, this phase retained the warmth of his Rose Period but conveyed a shift in both style and subject matter. Rather than produce figurative portrayals of performers, he began to depict abstracted, African mask-inspired representations of his subjects, from prostitutes in a Barcelona brothel (<em>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</em>, 1907) to the artist himself at age 25 (<em>Self-Portrait</em>, 1907).</p><br>

		<h3>
          <!-- Tagline -->
		Cubism (1908-1914)</h3>
		<p>The last of the artist's major periods I'll discuss before moving on to a closer examination of color, Cubism is a genre characterized by subject matter broken down into fractured forms. Pioneered by both Picasso and Georges Braque — a major 20th-century French painter, collagist, draughtsman, printmaker, and sculptor — Cubism is widely recognized as one of the most important art movements in the modern era. In Picasso's oeuvre, Cubism is separated into two primary phases: Analytical and Synthetic.</p>
		<p>Analytical Cubism (1908-1912) dominated the first four years of the movement, and is characterized by monochromatic, topsy-turvy canvases populated with overlapping, geometric forms. The arrangement of these fragments form the subject, which is often depicted from multiple angles at once, eschewing realistic constraints of hue, subject, symmetry, and perspective, as in <em>Girl with a Mandolin</em> (1910).</p><br>
		<center><img src="images/pablo-picasso-girl-with-mandolin.jpeg" width="750" height="1037" alt=""/></center><br>
		<p>Works depicted in the Synthetic Cubist style (1912-1914) were simplified, polychromatic, and inspired by collage art. Like the former phase of the movement, however, these works convey a continued interest in abstraction, as in <em>Guitar and Jug on a Table</em> (1918). While Picasso's Synthetic Cubist period would ostensibly come to an end around 1914, the artist would continue to return to the style until the 1920s.</p><br>
