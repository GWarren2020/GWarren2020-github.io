    <p class="text_column">MoMA’s publicly available datasets contain detailed metadata on over 100,000 works by more than 15,000 artists from around the world spanning 150 years. As MoMA’s curatorial team puts it: The Museum of Modern Art acquired its first artworks in 1929, the year it was established. Today, the Museum’s evolving collection contains almost 200,000 works from around the world spanning the last 150 years. The collection includes an ever-expanding range of visual expression, including painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing, photography, architecture, design, film, and media and performance art.<br><br>
        MoMA is committed to helping everyone understand, enjoy, and use the collection. The Museum’s website features 81,747 artworks from 26,352 artists. This research dataset contains 138,124 records, representing all of the works that have been accessioned into MoMA’s collection and cataloged in the database.</p>
    <p class="text_column">It includes basic metadata for each work, including title, artist, date made, medium, dimensions, and date acquired by the Museum.<br><br>
        The Artists dataset contains 15,853 records, representing all the artists who have work in MoMA's collection and have been cataloged in the database. It includes basic metadata for each artist, including name, nationality, gender, birth year, death year, Wiki QID, and Getty ULAN ID. These datasets are placed in the public domain using a CC0 License.<br><br>
        My goal is to exploit interactivity primarily via embedding from notebooks/visualizations I create in Observable, and I anticipate my project will represent an interactive exploratory visualization supported by textual/narrative elements, roughly along the lines of what one might see in data visualizations available through the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and others.</p>
