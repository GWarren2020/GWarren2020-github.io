### Project Description
For this project, I first introduce and briefly discuss works and themes from a selection of Picasso's major artistic periods. I then move on to more specifically address color in the artist's work. In this second section, I present a concise overview of a computational method for extracting and visualizing color value using MoMA's publicly available data and exploiting D3 to compute and display informative and engaging data-driven visualizations and interactive elements.
